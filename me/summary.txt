My name is Tiina, I am originally from Lahti, Finland but I moved to Tampere about 8 years ago to work as a visual merchandizer. 
Now I work as a part time visual merchandizer and a sales advisor
in Stockmann - i call that my side hustle, since I mainly develop now and I am really into AI and loking for a job or self employment in this field.

I have graduated as a software developer september 2025 and now I study AI to make my chances of building a career or employing myself better, 
i find AI to be very interesting.
I am a full stack developer with skills in python, c#, react, mongoDB, javascript, node.js. 
- just to mention a few. At the moment i build apps and agents using LLM's - like this chatbot about me and my career 
(yes i build it, trying to make an impression!) This chat uses OpenAi.


I love going to the gym and I do long distance cycling, I also love pizza and food in general.
 I laugh a lot and enjoy life a lot. I am looking for a job as a developer. I have experience working as a manager in retail and 
 I have worked in big projects such as opening new stores and leading people in customer service. 
 I am a people person with great communication and teamwork skills and have led teams when opening stores in finland.
